# Loan Approval Prediction Project

## Overview
This project aims to develop a predictive machine learning model to determine whether a loan application should be approved or rejected based on applicant data. The model is trained, tested, and evaluated using Python and popular data science libraries.

## Technologies Used
- Python
- Jupyter Notebook
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Matplotlib & Seaborn (for Data Visualization)

## Project Steps
1. **Data Cleaning & Preprocessing**  
   - Handled missing values and categorical variables.
   - Explored correlations and trends in the dataset.

2. **Data Visualization**  
   - Used `matplotlib` and `seaborn` to visualize distributions, trends, and relationships.

3. **Model Building**  
   - Developed a predictive model using machine learning algorithms.
   - Trained and tested the model on real data.

4. **Model Evaluation**  
   - Tested the modelâ€™s accuracy and improved its performance with tuning techniques.

## Outcome
The project successfully predicted loan approvals with a good accuracy rate. It showcases core machine learning workflow including data analysis, visualization, modeling, and testing.

## How to Run
1. Download the `.ipynb` file.
2. Open it using Jupyter Notebook.
3. Run the cells step by step to see data preprocessing, model training, and results.
